### Hello there!

I am a Software Developer working with technologies like Java (Spring Boot), Javascript (Reactjs, Nodejs), Golang, Ruby, Python (Flask), ELK, SQL/NoSQL Databases like Postgres/MongoDB etc. Here I post about my DIY project which have nothing to do with my Day job.

Sometimes, I write technical blogs on topics related to application development, encrytion, online-safety, 3D printing and similar topics. You can check out my blog at https://simarmannsingh.com. The blog is essentially a collection of lucid blog posts written specifically to explain technical concepts in layman words. No-prior knowledge is required to understand blog posts.

If you would want me to collaborate on some really interesting projects you have going on, don't hesitate to get in touch. You can contact me via this [**link**](https://hawkpost.co/box/7497c7bd-8404-43d5-a318-b161dfc318a4).
