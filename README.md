### Hello there!

I am a Software Developer working with technologies like Java (Spring Boot), Javascript (Reactjs, Nodejs), Python (Flask), ELK, SQL/NoSQL Databases like MongoDB/Postgres etc. I am a quick learner and a team player. Currently I am focussing on getting some meaningfull experience.

Also, I write technical blogs on topics related to application development, encrytion, online-safety, 3D printing and similar topics. Do check out my blog at https://simarmannsingh.com. The blog is essentially a collection of lucid blog posts written specifically to explain technical concepts in layman words. No-prior knowledge is required to understand blog posts. Do subscribe to my mailing list if you like the content. Its free and I don't collect any data.

Readers are encouraged to post honest opinions in comments and to share the content with their friends and family. It also helps me to clarify many concepts for myself because it is a fact that when you have to explain something to someone else, you study it thoroughly and hence you understand it better.

I advocate open-source projects and likes to contribute with some useful open-source projects that can help someone ease their workflow. For my latest contribution, you can check out the fully-responsive Gatsby based template web-app which can be easily hosted on any platform. It uses the Netlify CMS as its content management system. More details on the project can be found [**here**](https://github.com/simarmannsingh/gatsby-netlifycms-starter-template). If you like the project, don't forget to star the repo as it really motivates the developers to contribute more and more.

If you would want me to collaborate on some really interesting projects you have going on, don't hesitate to contact. You can contact me via this [**secure link**](https://hawkpost.co/box/7497c7bd-8404-43d5-a318-b161dfc318a4). It uses 4096 bit RSA encryption and redirects your message to a post-box only I can access.
