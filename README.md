### Hello there!

I am a recent Master graduate. I am working towards positions like Junior Frontend/Full-stack Developer where I could utilize my skillset more efficiently and grow faster. I am a quick learner and a team player. I've enough experience to get started and grow personally and professionally.

Also, I write technical blogs on topics related to application development, encrytion, online-safety, 3D printing and similar topics. Do check out my blog at https://simarmannsingh.com. The blog is essentially a collection of lucid blog posts written specifically to explain technical concepts in layman words. No-prior knowledge is required to understand blog posts. Do subscribe to my mailing list if you like the content. Its free and I don't collect any data.

Readers are encouraged to post honest opinions in comments and to share the content with their friends and family. It also helps me to clarify many concepts for myself because it is a fact that when you have to explain something to someone else, you study it thoroughly and hence you understand it better.

I advocate open-source projects and would want to contribute with some useful open-source project some day.
